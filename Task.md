# 🚀 FUTURE_CS_01 – Web Application Security Testing (OWASP Juice Shop)

## 📌 Overview  
As part of my cybersecurity internship with **Future Interns**, this task focused on performing **Web Application Security Testing** using the intentionally vulnerable application **OWASP Juice Shop**.  
The main objective was to simulate real-world penetration testing, identify vulnerabilities, intercept traffic using Burp Suite, and document findings in a professional security report.

---

## ✅ Key Highlights  
- Successfully deployed **OWASP Juice Shop using Docker** on Windows 11  
- Configured **Burp Suite** to intercept and analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic  
- Explored and mapped vulnerabilities to **OWASP Top 10**  
- Identified key issues including:  
  - Broken Authentication  
  - Reflected XSS (attempted)  
  - Unauthorized Access to Admin pages  
  - Security Misconfigurations  
- Captured all requests using Burp Suite’s intercept and HTTP history  
- Compiled a professional **Security Assessment Report (PDF)** with screenshots
